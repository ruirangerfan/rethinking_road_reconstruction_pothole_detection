<p>This repository provides the data used in our recent publication “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10802.pdf">Rethinking Road Surface 3D Reconstruction and Pothole Detection: From Perspective Transformation to Disparity Map Segmentation</a>”.</p>

<p><strong>A story behind this work:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When working on this project, I was a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When submitting this paper, I was a fresh postdoc at HKUST.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When this work was finally accepted, I have been working at UCSD for almost a year, and my postdoc career is nearly coming to an end…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We experienced a very annoying review process for this paper. It was originally submitted for peer-review on <strong>Apr. 11, 2019</strong>. We got the initial feedback on <strong>Jul. 28, 2019</strong>, and resubmitted our first revision on <strong>Aug. 22, 2019</strong>. However, nothing was back to us until <strong>Jul. 09, 2020</strong> (after DOZENS of emails from us enquiring about the reviewer’s feedback). We submitted the second revision on <strong>Aug. 06, 2020</strong>, and FINALLY got accepted on <strong>Jan. 01, 2021</strong>. So, it was reviewed for <strong>21 months</strong>. In my opinion, this work is already out-of-date when it was published. Anyway, I am going to provide you with the data we used in this work.</p>

<h2 id="road-pothole-detection-dataset">Road Pothole Detection Dataset</h2>

<p>The pothole detection dataset can be download from this <a href="https://github.com/ruirangerfan/stereo_pothole_datasets">repository</a>. You can run our demo code to see the visualization of different types of road data.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.ruirangerfan.com/pdf/tip2018_fan.pdf">previous work</a>, the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D road surface was evaluated using three sample models printed with a MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer. This is an indirect way! Therefore, in this work, we evaluated the accuracy of reconstructed road potholes in a straightforward way.</p>

<p>We first poured enough gypsum plaster into a pothole and dug the gypsum mold out, when it became dry and hardened. An example of the gypsum mold is shown below:</p>

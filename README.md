# Rethinking Road Surface 3D Reconstruction and Pothole Detection: From Perspective Transformation to Disparity Map Segmentation

This repository mainly provides the data used in our recent publication "[Rethinking Road Surface 3D Reconstruction and Pothole Detection: From Perspective Transformation to Disparity Map Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10802.pdf)". 

**A story behind this work:**

- When working on this project, I was a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol. 

- When submitting this paper, I was a fresh postdoc at HKUST. 

- When this work was finally accepted, I have been working at UCSD for almost a year and my postdoc career is nearly over...

We experienced a very annoying review process for this paper. It was originally submitted for peer-review on **Apr. 11, 2019**. We got the initial feedback on **Jul. 28, 2019**, and resubmitted our first revision on **Aug. 22, 2019**. However, nothing was back to us until **Jul. 09, 2020** (after DOZENS of emails from us enquiring about the reviewer's feedback). We submitted the second revision on **Aug. 06, 2020**, and FINALLY got accepted on **Jan. 01, 2021**. So, it was reviewed for **21 months**. In my opinion, this work is already out-of-date when it was accepted. Anyway, I am going to provide you with the data we used in this work.
